# Subagent brief: {{TICKET}} — {{TASK_TITLE}}

You are a pi subagent in repo `/var/home/sasha/para/areas/dev/gh/charly/specodelic`
(Rust CLI `specodelic`, alias `spk`). An orchestrator has claimed ticket
`{{TICKET}}` and is hands-off: you own the implementation end-to-end.
The orchestrator will verify with real gates — never claim work the diff
doesn't contain.

## Orientation (do this first)

- `export WAI_PROJECT={{WAI_PROJECT}}`
- Read, in order: the openspec change's `design.md` (esp. decision rows this
  ticket depends on), `tasks.md` (this ticket's section), `proposal.md` (slice
  scoping), then the delta specs this ticket extends.
- `wai search "<topic>"` — check accumulated patterns before designing.
- If your ticket maps to a tdd-ro5 run, start it and execute each step's
  prompt literally:
  `wai pipeline start tdd-ro5 --topic="{{TICKET}}: {{TASK_TITLE}}"`
  Advance ONLY via `wai pipeline next` — never hand-edit the run YAML under
  `.wai/pipeline-runs/`.

## What to build

{{TASK}}

## Hard scope guard

- Allowed files: {{SCOPE}}
- Never edit: `openspec/specs/`, `.espectacular/`, `pretender.toml`,
  `specs/` (the corpus), `.wai/resources/**`, this template.
- Respect shrink-only ratchets: run `pretender check` before committing; if a
  pinned source file breaches, move new tests to `tests/` rather than raising
  entries. `src/model_check.rs` is pinned (see `pretender.toml`) — new
  model-check tests go in `tests/` integration files.

## Repo facts (boilerplate — applies to every ticket)

- **Commit hygiene** (standing, every commit): before ANY `git commit`, run
  `git status --short` and stage only files YOU authored
  (`git add <paths>`, never bare `git add`); unstage foreign files.
  Attribute the message only to what the diff contains.
- **Output discipline**: every command emits through
  `genesis::guide::Output::emit`; errors carry a remediation hint.
- **beads**: issues live in `.beads/issues.jsonl`; commit the export after
  `bd close` (`bd export` gotcha: run it or the close is invisible to git).
- **Do NOT push** — the orchestrator verifies and pushes.
- **Do NOT run `wai close`** — the orchestrator owns session close.
- **ah/espectacular**: read-only over `openspec/`; contract TOMLs for
  change-phase scenarios are orphans until archive — author them in the
  archive commit, never mid-change.
- **New source files** need Purpose/Responsibilities/Rationale headers
  (file-headers skill convention).
- **Non-interactive shells**: use `-f`/`-rf`/`-y` flags; commands may be
  aliased with `-i` and will hang on prompts.

## Report format (end with this — the orchestrator verifies against it)

## Report

**Commits**
- `<hash>` <message> — <what it does, one line>

**Gates run**
- `just test` → <result>
- `ah check` → <result>
- `openspec validate --all --strict` → <result>

**Deviations** (or "none")
- <any scope/plan deviation and why>

**Next**
- <exact next action for the orchestrator, or "ticket complete">
